# Fireship.io Course: Svelte and Sveltekit

## Svelte in 100 Seconds

### Section 1: Intro

A Javascript (JS) tool for building UI components, similar to React, Angular or Vue. Unlike the rest of the JS frameworks though, instead of sending a JS runtime to the browser, it is a **_compiler_**. It takes the code you write (declarative code) and converts it into code that works with native browser APIs (imperative code). This creates highly performant code in a small package.

### Section 2: Components

Components are created in .svelte files. These files contain three main parts:

1. A script for JS code.
2. Style tag for CSS (Can also be a pre-processor like sass).
3. The main template represented as regular HTML. This HTML is special because it has been empowered with extra syntax for writing declarative code.

### Section 3: Reactive State

Need Reactive state, simply write a variable with let and reference dynamically in HTML using parenthesis.

If we want to change state we can write a function then listen to event in the DOM using "on" and bind the function to it as the handler (**_event binding_**).

When the value of that variable changes the component will auto re-render to show the updated state.

#### Example

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let count = 0;

	function addOne() {
		count += 1;
	}
</script>

<button on:click={addOne}>
	Clicked {count} Times
</button>
```

### Section 4: Conditional Logic or Loops

```svelte
<!-- If Else Statement. -->
{#if count > 0}
	<p>Nice work!</p>
{/if}

<!-- For Each Loop. -->
{#each ['üòâ', 'üòÜ', 'üòç'] as face}
	<p>Hello {face}</p>
{/each}
```

### Section 5: Cross Component Communication

Svelte has multiple ways to share data between components.

To pass data from a parent to child you can use props by providing the **_export_** keyword to a variable.

Then you can pass data into this component. If you have a ton of props you can use the **_spread_** syntax to keep code looking better.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let name: string;
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}</h1>

<User name="Jeff" color="blue" height="5" />

<!-- OR -->

<User {...myProps} />
```

### Section 6: Component Trees

For more complex component trees you have a **_context API_** just like React.

Svelte also has a mechanism called **_observable stores_**, which are like observables which can be shared anywhere in the component tree and subscribe to a template by putting a $ symbol in front of them.

```svelte

  <script>
  <!-- Component A -->
  setContext('icon', 'üçå');

  <!-- Component B -->
  const icon = getContext('icon');
  </script>

  <script>
  <!-- Stores -->
  import {writable} from 'svelte/store';

  const user = writable({ icon: '‚ù§Ô∏è' });
  </script>

  { $user.icon }
```

Section 7: Outro

After you have built your app you can then use the compiler to convert it to vanilla JS.

If you are building a full blown web app you can use Sveltekit to implement **_server side rendering_** (SSR), **_routing_** and **_code splitting_**.

## Create a Sveltekit app

`npm create svelte@latest nameofapp` or for interactive setup run `npx sv create nameofapp`.

Then you CD into the app created above and run pnpm run dev.

### Project Breakdown

There will be a vite config which is the build tool that bundles all of the code, a tsconfig (if typescript), a tailwind config (if using tailwind), and most importantly a svelte config which controls the settings for the framework itself.

#### Svelte Config

You can use adapters defined in this file to deploy the app to most major platforms with minimal configuration.

#### Source Directory

There is a **src** and **static** directory. Static is for static files such as logos, font files or other assets you want to deploy alongside your app. Source code is all contained in the `src` directory.

The route of every page in the app is surrounded by the `app.html` file. Within it you will notice a few special insertion points (i.e. %sveltekit.head%), which will be replaced with code from your sveltekit components.

There is also an `app.d.ts` file which is used to create your own type definitions in typescript.

The `routes` directory (dir) is important. This is where you define all of the logic and UI for all of the pages in the app.

The `lib` dir is also special in svelte because it is auto mapped to a `$` ($lib) which means you can import from it without having to write the full relative path in your code.

For example:

```svelte
<script>
	import { user, userData } from '$lib/firebase';
</script>
```

It will be used to add reusable utilities and components that aren't tied to a specific route in the app.

## Routing

Sveltekit has a file system based routing. Meaning the URL for users are determined by the file naming and structure in the routes dir.

Routes can be **dynamic** (surrounded by square brackets) such as a username pulled from a database. The framework identifies this as a URL parameter which you can access elsewhere in the framework like when fetching data.

### Page Store

Sometimes you want to access user data on the client side instead of the server. This can be done with a built in `$page` store (i.e. `$page.params.username`).

The page store contains the page store ($page), the route params (params), and additional info from the router. Anytime the route changes the store value will update reactively.

### Svelte Filenames

Svelte has four special filenames prefixed with a + symbol. These are **_page_**, **_layout_**, **_server_**, and **_error_**. These files will end in either **_.svelte_**, **_.ts_**, or **_.server.ts_**. The most common file is the `page.svelte` file. The page file is what is rendered when a user navigates to that URL.

On the initial load of the page it will be rendered on the **_server_**, which is good for SEO because bots need fully rendered HTML to understand the page.

After the initial page load Svelte will **_hydrate_** the page, the client side JS will take over and we will be able to render subsequent navigations client side. This is faster and more efficient as well as better user experience (UX).

#### +page.svelte

- **used for**: building UI.
- **runs on**: client & server.

#### +page.ts

- **used for**: data fetching.
- **runs on**: client & server.

#### +page.server.ts

- **used for**: data fetching.
- **runs on**: server only.

#### +layout.ts

Same group of patterns for +layout.ts. These work the same as pages, but their UI can be shared among multiple child routes.

Two more file types:

#### +server.ts

- **used for**: API routes (Routes that don't return HTML, but JSON or another response type).
- **runs on**: server only.

#### +error.svelte

Fallback for a page when data fetching fails.

- **used for**: API routes.
- **runs on**: server only.
